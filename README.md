# 🌟 IoT Streetlight System
  This project implements an IoT-based system for controlling streetlights efficiently. 
  It utilizes sensors and IoT technology to dynamically adjust streetlight intensity based on surrounding ambient light levels.
  This improves energy efficiency and reduces light pollution by ensuring streetlights are only at full brightness when needed.

## 🛠️ Components Used

- 📟 **LDR Sensor** - Light-dependent resistor to detect sunlight intensity.
- ☔ **Rain Sensor** - Detects rain and adjusts smart umbrella behavior accordingly.
- 🛠️ **Arduino IDE** - Software platform for programming and interfacing with the hardware.
- 🔄 **Servo Motor** - To open and close the smart umbrella.
- 🌬️ **Turbine** - To generate electricity from collected rain water.
